                        As most things go, you should learn to crawl before you start running. The goal behind this project was to understand
                        some of the basics in Python.

                        This was somewhat of a courages project. I threw myself into the deep end to get a better grasp on using classes in Python.
                        It turned out to be one of the projects I went back to the most, it's a simple game, but the battles can become quite intense,
                        seeing that all the options are luck dependant.

                        Ever heard the saying "Don't reinvent the wheel"? Well this project was wholely focused on reinventing one of the most important
                        softwares ever made for our day-to-day lives. With about 1 or 2 weeks of constant debugging, I achieved a <strong>somewhat</strong> working
                        Point of Sale software solution for a make believe restaurant. This project reminds me that no matter how sound your code may look,
                        there will always be a landmine waiting for you to step onto it. Lesson: Debug, debug, debug.
